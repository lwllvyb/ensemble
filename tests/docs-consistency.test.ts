/**
 * Docs-consistency tests.
 *
 * These exist because the documentation drifted away from the code repeatedly, and every time
 * it was a human who eventually noticed. Each assertion here encodes a drift that actually
 * happened, so the next one fails in CI instead of on a reader:
 *
 *  - `--full-auto` stayed in the agents.json example for months after Codex CLI 0.147.0 removed
 *    it, so anyone who copy-pasted the example got `unexpected argument '--full-auto' found`.
 *  - SKILL.md advertised an agent key (`fable`) that is not in agents.json. Unknown keys are not
 *    an error: resolveAgentProgram() falls back to claude, so it silently spawned a second claude.
 *  - Three separate pages called Claude Code the default lead while collab-launch.sh has always
 *    built its payload with codex as lead.
 *
 * The rule of thumb for adding one: assert something derivable from the code, not something a
 * writer has to keep in their head.
